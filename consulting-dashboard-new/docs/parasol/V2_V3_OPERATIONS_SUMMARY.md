## 🎨 V3 Structure Quality

### Operation README Structure (100% consistent)

Every operation README includes:
- ✅ Operation definition (How: この操作の定義)
- ✅ Design references (domain, API, data)
- ✅ UseCase placeholder with Phase 4 notice
- ✅ V2 reference link with migration notice
- ✅ Update history with creation date
- ✅ Status indicators (Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 next)

### Directory Structure (100% compliant)

```
L3-XXX-{l3-name}/
└── operations/
    └── OP-XXX-{operation-name}/
        ├── README.md          ✅ Created
        └── usecases/          ✅ Placeholder ready for Phase 4
```

### Cross-References (100% implemented)

Each operation links to:
- ✅ BC-level domain model (../../../../domain/README.md)
- ✅ BC-level API specification (../../../../api/README.md)
- ✅ BC-level data model (../../../../data/README.md)
- ✅ V2 operation source (relative path to services/)
- ✅ Migration status document (../../../../MIGRATION_STATUS.md)

## 🔍 V2→V3 Mapping Highlights

### Key Consolidations

1. **decompose-and-define-tasks**: Referenced by both L3-001 and L3-003 (DRY principle)
2. **workload-tracking**: 3 operations integrated into BC-005/L3-001
3. **deliver-immediate-information**: Merged with send-notification in BC-007/L3-002
4. **Organization structure**: Split from BC-003 to BC-004 (3 operations)

### Service → BC Transformation

| V2 Service | → | V3 BC | Operation Change |
|------------|---|-------|------------------|
| project-success-service | → | BC-001 | 12 → 13 (decompose duplication) |
| secure-access-service | → | BC-003 + BC-004 | 12 → 9 + 3 (split) |
| collaboration-facilitation | → | BC-007 | 3 → 4 (consolidation) |
| talent-optimization | → | BC-005 | 12 + 3 (with productivity-viz) |
| revenue-optimization | → | BC-002 | 14 → 14 (no change) |
| knowledge-co-creation | → | BC-006 | 6 → 6 (split into 2 L3s) |

## 💡 Key Insights & Lessons

### Mapping Complexity

1. **1:1 Majority**: Most V2 operations map 1:1 to V3 (55/62 = 89%)
2. **Consolidations**: 7 operations involved in mergers/splits
3. **Service Split**: secure-access split into BC-003 and BC-004
4. **Service Merge**: productivity-visualization absorbed into BC-005

### Naming Consistency

- ✅ Operation IDs: OP-001, OP-002, OP-003 within each L3
- ✅ Operation names: Kebab-case from V2 preserved
- ✅ Japanese titles: Original V2 titles used
- ✅ README structure: 100% template compliance

### Quality Assurance

- ✅ All operations have V2 reference links
- ✅ All operations have migration notices
- ✅ All operations have placeholder usecases/ directories
- ✅ All operations follow consistent README template
- ✅ All operations link to BC-level design documents

## 🎓 Migration Patterns Established

### Pattern 1: Standard Operation Migration
```
V2: services/[service]/capabilities/[cap]/operations/[op]/
→
V3: business-capabilities/BC-XXX/capabilities/L3-XXX/operations/OP-XXX/
```

### Pattern 2: Consolidated Operation
```
V2: services/service-A/capabilities/cap/operations/op-1/
V2: services/service-B/capabilities/cap/operations/op-2/
→
V3: business-capabilities/BC-XXX/capabilities/L3-XXX/operations/OP-XXX/
    (with references to both V2 sources)
```

### Pattern 3: Split Operation (BC-003 → BC-003 + BC-004)
```
V2: services/secure-access/capabilities/manage-org-structure/
→
V3: business-capabilities/BC-004/capabilities/L3-001/operations/
    (organizational operations split out)
```

### Pattern 4: Service Absorption (productivity-viz → BC-005)
```
V2: services/productivity-visualization/capabilities/workload-tracking/
→
V3: business-capabilities/BC-005/capabilities/L3-001/operations/
    (integrated into resource planning)
```
