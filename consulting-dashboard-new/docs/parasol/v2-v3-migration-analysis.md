## Part 2: V2-to-V3 Business Capability Mapping Proposal

### Design Principles for V3 BCs

## Part 3: Consolidation Recommendations & Redundancy Analysis

### Identified Duplications in V2

| Duplicate | V2 Location | V3 Recommendation |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| decompose-and-define-tasks | Appears in 2 places: plan-and-structure-project AND manage-and-complete-tasks | **CONSOLIDATE into BC#1 L3 "Project Planning & Structure"** |
| execute-skill-development | Appears in 2 places: execute-skill-development AND visualize-and-develop-skills | **MERGE into single capability BC#5 "Talent Development & Performance"** |
| deliver-notifications vs. send-notification | Similar but different (urgent vs. general) | **KEEP SEPARATE** (different SLAs), but consolidate operations under single L3 capability |
| optimize-profitability vs. analyze-profitability | Seem redundant | **CONSOLIDATE** into "Profitability Analysis & Optimization" in BC#2 |
| track-revenue | Appears under optimize-profitability separately | **MERGE** into "Revenue & Cash Flow Management" L3 |

### Consolidation Impact

- **Operations Reduced**: 77 → 60-71 (12-18% consolidation)
- **Capabilities Organized**: 24 → 22-24 (slight reduction due to better grouping)
- **Clarity Gained**: Heavy (overloaded services clarified into focused BCs)

### Phase 2: Capability Redesign (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Document each L3 capability in v2.0 format
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate operations
- [ ] Create 1:1 CapabilityCard → L3 Capability mapping

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (1 week)
- [ ] Plan phased rollout of new structure
- [ ] Map existing code/databases to new BCs
- [ ] Create migration playbook

### Phase 4: Execution (Parallel development)
- [ ] Migrate BC#3 (Access Control) - Foundation
- [ ] Migrate BC#2 (Financial) - Independent
- [ ] Migrate BC#1 (Project Delivery) - Largest, interdependent
- [ ] Migrate BC#5, BC#6, BC#7 - Supporting

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
