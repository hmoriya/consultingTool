## Key Consolidations & Fixes

### Duplicates to Consolidate

| Duplicate | V2 Locations | Impact | V3 Fix |
|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| **decompose-and-define-tasks** | plan-and-structure-project + manage-and-complete-tasks | Planning confused with execution | Single L3 "Project Planning & Structure" |
| **execute-skill-development** | execute-skill-development cap + visualize-and-develop-skills cap | Skill execution duplicated | Single "Talent Development & Performance" L3 |
| **send-notification vs. deliver-notifications** | Different urgency levels | SLA confusion | Split by SLA: general async vs. urgent immediate |
| **optimize-profitability vs. analyze-profitability** | Two similar capabilities in financial service | Redundant analysis | Single "Profitability Analysis & Optimization" L3 |
| **track-revenue** | Separate from revenue management | Scattered revenue tracking | Merge into "Revenue & Cash Flow Management" |

**Total Impact**: Removes 3-5 operational redundancies, improves clarity

## Sizing Analysis

### By Operations Count

```
BC#1: Project Delivery (12-15 ops) [LARGEST - may need splitting]
BC#2: Financial Health (13-14 ops) [Large, well-consolidated]
BC#5: Team & Resources (13-14 ops) [Large, requires consolidation]
BC#3: Access Control (9 ops) [Medium]
BC#6: Knowledge Mgmt (6 ops) [Small, well-focused]
BC#7: Communication (4-5 ops) [Small, enabler]
BC#4: Org Governance (3-4 ops) [Smallest - may grow]
```

### By L3 Capability Count

```
BC#1: 5 L3s [At upper limit]
BC#2: 4 L3s [Well-sized]
BC#5: 4 L3s [Well-sized]
BC#3: 3 L3s [Well-sized]
BC#6: 2-3 L3s [On lower limit]
BC#7: 2-3 L3s [On lower limit]
BC#4: 1-2 L3s [Below guideline - growth opportunity or merge]
```

**Recommendation**: Sizes are mostly within 3-5 L3 capability guideline. BC#1 may warrant review.

---

## Dependencies & Interactions

### Critical Dependencies

```
All BCs depend on:
├─ BC#3 (Access Control) - Authentication foundation for everything
└─ BC#7 (Communication) - Information flow enabler

BC#1 (Project) depends on:
├─ BC#5 (Resources) - Resource assignment
├─ BC#2 (Financial) - Budget tracking
└─ BC#6 (Knowledge) - Knowledge application

BC#2 (Financial) depends on:
├─ BC#1 (Project) - Cost allocation
└─ BC#5 (Resources) - Cost per resource
```

**Implication**: BC#3 must migrate first (foundation), then BC#1, BC#2, BC#5 in parallel

## Migration Complexity

### Complexity Rating by BC

| BC | Operations | L3 Caps | Consolidations | Complexity | Priority |
|----|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| BC#3 | 9 | 3 | 0 | LOW | 1st (Foundation) |
| BC#2 | 13-14 | 4 | 3-4 | MEDIUM | 2nd (Independent) |
| BC#7 | 4-5 | 2-3 | 1-2 | MEDIUM | 3rd (Enabler) |
| BC#1 | 12-15 | 5 | 1 | HIGH | 4th (Complex, depends on 3,5) |
| BC#5 | 13-14 | 4 | 1 | MEDIUM | 5th (Resources, depends on 3) |
| BC#6 | 6 | 2-3 | 0 | LOW | 6th (Independent) |
| BC#4 | 3-4 | 1-2 | 0 | LOW | 7th (Governance, small) |

## Recommendation: Architecture Review Checklist

Before proceeding with migration, validate:

- [ ] **Service Purpose Alignment**: V3 BC names match business value (not technical functions)
- [ ] **Capability Consolidation**: Identified duplicates are genuine redundancies
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis**: All BC→BC dependencies identified and acceptable
- [ ] **Operation Sizing**: Each L3 capability has 1-4 operations (no outliers)
- [ ] **BC Sizing**: Each BC has 3-5 L3 capabilities (guideline compliance)
- [ ] **Migration Sequence**: Dependency order supports parallel development
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Consolidations reviewed by domain experts
- [ ] **Stakeholder Alignment**: Service owners briefed on proposed changes

---

## Key Insights

1. **Well-Designed V2**: Overall structure is quite good; only 3-5 actual duplicates
2. **Improvement Opportunity**: 12-18% operational reduction through consolidation
3. **Clear Value Alignment**: All V3 BCs have distinct business value propositions
4. **Manageable Complexity**: No BC exceeds reasonable scope (largest is 5 L3s)
5. **Strategic Decisions**:
   - Split org-structure from security to governance (strategic change)
   - Elevate productivity-visualization into resource optimization (size fix)
   - Keep knowledge management separate (strategic capability)

---

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Architecture Review** | 1 week | Review docs, validate approach, stakeholder alignment |
| **Detailed Design** | 2 weeks | Create BC definition documents, finalize mappings |
| **Implementation Planning** | 1 week | Create detailed migration plan, identify risks |
| **Phased Migration** | 6-8 weeks | Execute BC migration (parallel where possible) |
| **Validation & Closure** | 1-2 weeks | Integration testing, documentation, go-live |
| **TOTAL** | **11-15 weeks** | ~3-4 months |

---

## Next Actions

1. Share these documents with architecture review team
2. Schedule design review meeting (focus on dependencies)
3. Brief service owners on proposed mappings
4. Validate consolidation decisions with domain experts
5. Create detailed BC definition documents in v2.0 format
6. Develop detailed implementation roadmap
